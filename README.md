# 11-Classification-Homework


### Background: Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked that you help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

In this project, I will build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so this needs to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. 



### Credit Risk Resampling Techniques

Final Conclusion:

1. SMOTE model had the best balanced accuracy score.

2. All models had the best performance of recall score.

3. All models had the best performance of geometric mean scores.


## Ensemble Learning

Final Conclusion:

1. The Easy Ensemble Classifier had the best balanced accuracy score.
 
2. The Easy Ensemble Classifier had a good standing of recall score which is 0.94.

3. The Easy Ensemble Classifier had a good standing of geometric mean score which is 0.93.
 
4. The top3 features are: interest rate, borrower income, and debt.
